# PolarPoint: Point to celestial and orbital north

https://rrazor.github.io/polarpoint

Launch the app. Orient north and tap the button, then pivot around to find colored boxes indicating the two different north directions (celestial and orbital), as well as the ecliptic plane. You can tap to expand controls in the upper-right, where you can tweak the latitude, longtitude, and current date and time.

(To adjust the date and time, first uncheck the "Current Time" checkbox at the bottom.)

## Supported Devices

PolarPoint is optimized for mobile Safari on iOS. You can run it in a browser, but you will need to simulate device orientation events to "steer" the display.

## Installation

$ npm install
```
